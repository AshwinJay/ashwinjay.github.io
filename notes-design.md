# Common sense coding preferences (mostly for Java)

## JVM
 - [JVM bytecode](http://blog.jamesdbloom.com/JavaCodeToByteCode_PartOne.html)
 - [JVM internals](http://blog.jamesdbloom.com/JVMInternals.html)
 - [Aleksey ShipilÑv's posts describing some elementary piece of knowledge about JVM](https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/)

## Code generation

### Lombok

Restrict its use to the bare minimum.

 - `@Slf4j`
 - `@Getter`
 - `@Setter`
 - `@Data` if you want both get/set
 - `@EqualsAndHashcode` if `@Data` is not used and you want to be explicit about the fields

### Misc Java

 - Stick to plain Java and IDE code generation as much as possible without adding too much cruft
 - IDE assisted `equals/hashcode` if needed to customize objects stored in high performance collections

## Dependency Injection

### Guice

Stick to explicit Java in all places other than the one place where you bind things.

 - No Guice annotations in any class other than `AbstractModule`s
 - Rely on `@Provides` and `@Singleton` annotated methods to instantiate objects explicitly and bind/return them
 - Plain Java constructors invoked explicitly by the module's provider methods
 - Debatable: Use `@Inject` on 1 method in the module (which itself is injected) to contain the module's startup logic

```java
public class FruitModule extends AbstractModule {
  @Provides
  Apple makeApple(){
   return new Apple();
  }

  @Provides
  @Singleton
  Flour makeFlour(){
   return new WheatFlour();
  }

  @Provides
  ApplePie makeApplePie(Apple apple, Flour flour){
   return new ApplePie(apple, flour);
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle

 - `Autocloseable` if cleanup is required for manual `try/finally` - typically short lived but expensive objects with resources
 - `@PreDestroy` if the cleanup needs to be handled during shutdown - typically long lived objects

## Style

### Visibility

 - `private` + `final` in most cases
 - `package-local` + `final` if sub-class needs it
 - `package-local` method, class, constructor by default unless otherwise needed
 - `@VisibleForTesting` if `package-local` or `protected` method needs to be exposed for testing. Generally should be avoided as it may leak encapsulation
 - `@VisibleForTesting` if `package-local` or `protected` constructors on the other hand are much better as they declare all their dependencies upfront
 - `protected` constructor and perhaps fields of abstract classes that will be sub-classed from other packages

### Member variables

 - Non-`static` Fields are initialized in the constructor
 - Initialization at the site of field declaration is nice only if:
  - It is a `static` field
  - Non-`static` field but the field needs a default value when used in conjunction with Lombok or Hibernate validator

```java
@Getter
@Setter
public class PieRecipe {
    private static final int DEFAULT_FLOUR_GRAMS = 250;

    @NotBlank
    private String name;

    @Min(0)
    private int sugarGrams;

    @Min(100)
    private int flourGrams = DEFAULT_FLOUR_GRAMS;

    @Valid
    private List<Flavor> optionalFlavors;
}
```

### Exceptions

[No](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html) [checked](http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs2.html) [exceptions](http://radio-weblogs.com/0122027/stories/2003/04/01/JavasCheckedExceptionsWereAMistake.html).

### Formatting

Prefer readability over compactness while formatting code. Sometimes the IDE's automatic formatting may have to be overridden manually.

```java
public BigClass(
        int foo, String bar, float fizz, Object bizz, List<String> names) {
  ...
}

public BigClass(
        int foo, String bar, float fizz, Object bizz, 
        List<String> names, Map<String, Long> moreNames) {
  ...
}

void hello()  {
    world(
      xx, yy, zz, aa, bb, more, stillMore, manyMore, 
      others, moreOthers.values().stream().count()
    );
}

List<Integer> ids = allObjects
          .keySet()
          .stream()
          .filter(foo -> foo > 34)
          .map()
          .collect(Collectors.toList());
          
List<String> items = few
      ? new ImmutableList.Builder()
            .add("foo")
            .add("bar")
            .build()
      : Lists.newArrayList("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee", "ff", ....);
```

### Ordering of methods

```java
//In unit tests.

@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@Test testXX
@Test testYY
...
```

### Thread safety
 
 - By default all classes and methods are assumed not safe
 - Thread safe classes are marked by an explicit `@ThreadSafe` annotation
 
### Naming

 - Avoid plurals in package names
 - Prefer plural form of class name if it is a `Factory` or something similar. Ex: `JobExecutors` or `FooBuilders` or `Constants`
 - Some pointers from Java 8 Time API: [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/overview/naming.html) & [that](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/overview/design.html) 

### Constants

```java
public final class FooBarConstants {
    //"PROP" or "KEY" prefix for property or map keys.
    public static final String PROP_CONFIG_FILE_NAME = "app.config.file";
    
    //"VAL" prefix for fixed property or map values.
    public static final String VAL_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE_NAME = "conf/default.properties";
    
    //"VAR" prefix for template strings that can vary slightly.
    public static final String VAR_ERR_MSG_AGE = "The value [%s] provided for 'age' is invalid";
    
    //Private ctor and an abstract class. Prevent sub-classing and instantiation.
    private FooBarConstants() {
    }
}
```
 
### (Java)Docs, comments and logs

 - First time reference to nouns (Class or actors) use the literal names with correct capitalization or if available  `{@link LoanProcessor}` or `{@code Approval agent}`. Subsequent references may be in lower case (`the loan processor retries using ...`)
 - Follow proper punctuation and capitalization rules
 - Log and exception messages have parameters wrapped within brackets. Ex: `log.error("The directory [{}] does not exist", dirName.toString())`

## Non-Java files and resources

Prefer non-source code file and directory names like - `~/data-feed/all-lower-case-with-hyphens.csv`.

## Unit tests

We tend to focus on the "core" parts of the test but often ignore to clarify test boundaries, confirm the absence of unwanted start/end states and test for side effects.

- Establish the test boundary and system under test (a specific method of a specific class when unit testing). This means using the `Assert.assertXXX` methods even before the test mutates the state. i.e confirm your assumptions. It is also a great way to document the behavior and makes code reviews easy
  Ex: `assertEquals(0, customers.size())`
- Confirm that the parts that are not being tested and should not be affected are indeed untouched. i.e side-effect free. So, if mock objects are being used, it means doing something like:
```java 
  Mockito
     .verify(xx, never())
     .fooBar()
```
- Using `Assert.fail(xx)` more often to confirm that certain test code paths are not executed. 
   Ex: 
```java
   try { 
     //Actual test that triggers config ex
     ... 
     Assert.fail("Should've thrown config ex")
   } catch(ExpectedConfigException e) { 
     log.debug("Expected", e)
   }
```
